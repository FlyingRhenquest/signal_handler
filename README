This is a cleanup of the signal handler in my old socket server code. I'm
going to dig into that project in a bit and see if I can clean it up a bit,
and I wanted to start by breaking this portion of it out. This object manages
a threaded signal handler, mostly so I can catch the SIGHUPs when sockets
close in the socket server code. See signal_handler comments and test code
for usage.

I'm building this on a C++11-enabled C++ compiler, but am mostly using
boost libraries for this. They seem pretty similar to the new std ones,
but will be more compatible with older compilers. To port this back you
could just replace the nullptrs with NULLs and remove the -std=c++11
from the makefiles and that should do it.
